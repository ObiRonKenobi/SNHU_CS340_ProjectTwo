Client/Server Development

~ How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

  The simplest way to write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable is to work reiteratively and avoid gold plating and redundancy. The CRUD module is developed to be very simple and concise and as such is reusable with multiple applications. This CRUD module could be adapted to develop different dashboards or even retooled to  parse different data.

~ How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

  As a Computer Scientist, one should approach problems incrementally. This project was very incremental as we first developed the database, then the CRUD module, and finally the dashboard. Considering how the data will be stored and utilized and developing a CRUD module to access that data is an advisable strategy for future client projects.

~ What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

  Computer Scientists study the efficiency and effectiveness of different platforms systems and methods. As such, a computer scientist could help a company like Grazioso Salvare do their work better by implementing sound, maintainable, and reusable solutions for parsing and interpreting data.
